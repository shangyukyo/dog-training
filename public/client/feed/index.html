				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading a dog’s body language is paramount for securing a confident relationship between owner and animal. Dogs don’t lie or hide their emotions and they depend primarily upon visual signals – they are constantly telling humans exactly what they mean by their posture, movements and gaze.</p>
<p><span id="more-139"></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, these signals can be misread if you do not have the knowledge to decipher them. Here are some ways to listen to your dog to better <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/top-10-tips-for-professional-dog-trainers/">understand and train them</a>.</p>
<h2>When Your Dog Is Relaxed and Happy</h2>
<p>As a dog owner, there’s no better feeling than seeing your companion relaxed and comfortable in their surroundings. This state is easily recognisable as your dog will have a totally relaxed position; open mouth and neutral tail – possibly moving side to side or in a round motion. In this state, it is likely the dog will turn over and invite a belly rub or wiggle their backside.</p>
<h2>The Signs of Stress, Discomfort and Fear in Your Dog</h2>
<p>It’s important to take note of your dog’s distress signals in order to prevent heightened aggression. Dogs will exhibit many signs that help them relieve stress or attempt to appease a perceived threat.</p>
<p>Yawning and lip licking/tongue flicking are common behaviours but they can also clearly signal discomfort in certain situations. A dog will briefly freeze before they react or turn their head away while still looking at the perceived threat, showing the whites of their eyes. A sudden release of adrenalin causes a dog to shake or attempt to gain comfort from their owner. <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/specialist-trainers/">Well-trained dogs</a> are less likely to lose focus and behave fearfully in potentially threatening situations.</p>
<h2>Defensive, Offensive and Aggressive Dog Behaviour</h2>
<p>When a stressful situation reaches the point where a dog has to defend themselves from a perceived or real threat, they will encourage the threat to keep a distance with defensive behaviour. This behaviour will quickly become offensive if not subdued.</p>
<p>In this state, your dog will lean their body forward and tense and vibrate their mouth as they growl. They may snap at the air or at skin contact as a warning. A dog that bites and holds their target intends to harm; if they begin to shake their prey this could potentially mean intent to kill. If your dog is <u>prone to aggression</u>, take the steps to understand and correct this through a professional <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/general-information/?COLLCC=1868598787">dog obedience course</a>.</p>
<h2>Often Misunderstood Dog Body Language</h2>
<p>Humans frequently misinterpret dog signals, such as tail wagging. A wagging tail definitely can mean a dog is happy, but some dogs also wag their tails when they’re aroused, over stimulated, frustrated or angry. The easiest way to tell the difference is by assessing the rest of their body.</p>
<p>When dogs are corrected for bad behaviour, they will often sulk and leave the room. Humans interpret this as the dog being upset; we will often feel guilty, as though they should “make it up” to our dog. Giving space and turning away are actually submissive behaviours, meaning the dog is giving in and accepting the human as leader. Apologising to the dog afterwards sends mixed signals. Pet-owner relationships benefit from humans trying to understand their animal rather than assuming they use the same body language signals as we do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the name suggests, Competitive Obedience Training is the display of well-trained dogs having their abilities tested and executing each exercise with precision and accuracy. Our obedience experts are here to help you learn more about starting your dog’s training in this challenging and rewarding sport.</p>
<p><span id="more-137"></span></p>
<h2>What is Competitive Obedience Training?</h2>
<p>The ultimate objective of obedience trials is to produce and showcase dogs that have been perfectly trained and conditioned to behave in the home, in public spaces, and in the presence of other dogs. Undertaking competition obedience means striving for precise performances, correct responses to signals and flawless teamwork in an assessed environment.</p>
<p>Completing a <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/general-information/">canine training course</a> involves gaining a scientific understanding of conditioning and reward systems. In dog obedience certification, students learn the psychology behind animal behaviour, intelligence, Pavlovian conditioning, socialisation, desensitisation and counter conditioning.</p>
<h2>Mastering Different Methods of Training</h2>
<p>A certificate III in dog training is designed to teach students the <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/top-10-tips-for-professional-dog-trainers/">golden rules and tricks</a> used by dog trainers – from simple tasks to complex behaviours. The NDTF is the national representative body for dog trainers in Australia, and we explore a variety of training methods. Students are taught the basic principles behind multiple teaching styles and an expert understanding of each style’s advantages and disadvantages. Equipped with thorough knowledge, they can go on to apply the training technique that best suits the needs of their individual canine.</p>
<p>A dog training course also contains practical, ‘hands-on’ components that cover the training of dogs of all ages in every facet of obedience. With the opportunity to work with multiple breeds and ages, students have the chance to discover which method is successful in different situations.</p>
<h2>Exercises in Competitive Obedience Training</h2>
<p>Beginner exercises range from heelwork (on and off leash) to control exercises such as a timed sit or stay. Progressing through the classes means the exercises become more complex and rewarding. One interesting example of an upper-level test is the “scent discrimination” exercise where a dog makes a choice based on a particular, conditioned smell. It’s amazing to see just <u>how much a dog can be taught</u>! The sections are given a maximum number of points and judges assess each dog and handler against their personal opinion of perfect execution.</p>
<h2>How to Gain Qualifications in Obedience Training</h2>
<p>You can achieve a certificate III in dog training either online or through part-time classes. Previous experience with dogs is not essential and you do not have to own your own dog. If you have access to a friend or family member&#8217;s dog, you can undertake at least 3 x 30-minute sessions per week for a period of approximately 4-5 months. <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/study-requirements/">The NDTF course</a> goes far beyond teaching the basic principles of obedience handling. It gives students the necessary knowledge to teach dogs advanced skills and tricks that can be used in film, television or prestigious competitions.</p>
<p>If you have any enquiries about Competitive Obedience Training or if you wish to enrol in a canine training certification, <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/contact-us/">contact the NDTF online</a> or call <strong>1300 66 44 66.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A puppy will begin training with its mother and breeder as an infant. Once you’ve got the go ahead to bring your new canine friend home, it’s vital to know the immediate steps for training. Here, we’ve provided our expert opinion on the early stages of training your puppy.</p>
<p><span id="more-135"></span></p>
<h2>At What Age Should a Puppy Begin Training?</h2>
<p>Some training and socialisation will have already begun from the moment your puppy opened its eyes and started walking. Despite their short attention spans, from as young as 7 weeks, you can expect them to respond to basic commands such as “sit”, “down” and “stay”. Having a <u>stable reward system </u>will enforce positive behaviour.</p>
<h2>Daily Routines for Your Puppy</h2>
<p>There are a few simple things that you can instil in a puppy from day one. By consistently returning the puppy to his water and food dishes, you can teach them important locations around your house. Feeding at set times of the day regulates a puppy’s appetite and sense of restraint. Teach the puppy where its bed is and enforce sleep and wake times to further a rigid routine.</p>
<p>The only way your puppy will learn is through consistency. If they do something right, reward and praise them with enthusiasm. If the behaviour is inappropriate, make it clear that you are unhappy with a strong, “No” or by ignoring them. If you fail to be consistent, you can expect the same from your puppy!</p>
<h2>Teaching Your Puppy Words</h2>
<p>Praise and correction words should be started at 2-3 months old. Using the correct tone of voice and body language, you will be able to properly teach commands such as “No” and “Good”. This will help your puppy differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate behaviour. Mastering these simple commands will make it easier to move onto teaching more complex words.</p>
<h2>Housebreaking Your Puppy</h2>
<p>At 2-3 months of age, a puppy does not have reliable control of their bladder. You can begin housebreaking them from the moment you bring them home but practising patience will make this transition easier. Use <u>positive reinforcement </u>when your puppy shows successful signs of housebreaking and consistently return them to the appropriate place when they make a mistake. Establishing the right patterns means your puppy will be housebroken as soon as they master the control of their bladder.</p>
<h2>Professional Puppy Training Classes</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/specialist-trainers/">Formal canine training</a> is most valuable for puppies 8 weeks and older. Anything that has been learned incorrectly will need to be undone and re-taught, so it is wise to begin the training as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Taking the time to learn alongside your puppy and completing a <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/general-information/">certificate III in dog training</a> will ensure you are well-equipped to handle any situation at home. A dog behaviour course is a valuable way to prevent the formation of negative habits.</p>
<p>To begin the right training for your pawed friend or to learn more about undertaking a canine training course, speak to an NDTF expert <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/contact-us/">online</a> or call <strong>1300 66 44 66</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re discovering aggressive behavioural changes in your dog, it is important to understand the possible reasons behind these changes and learn how you can correct them instantly. Read on for help identifying the source of aggression and some informed steps to overcome it.</p>
<p><span id="more-133"></span></p>
<h2>Forms of Canine Aggression</h2>
<h3>Leash aggression</h3>
<p>When a dog feels restrained, uncomfortable or endangered in a situation, they will often react with leash lunging and displays of dominance. In unleashed circumstances, a dog would be able to identify a potential threat and place enough distance between themselves and the source of fear. However, when restrained and incapable of creating this distance, they will react defensively in hopes of scaring away the threat. If this behaviour is reinforced by successfully creating that distance, they are very likely to repeat these actions.</p>
<p>Identify the cause of this discomfort and begin desensitising your dog to the distraction. Place emphasis on giving your dog something else to do immediately instead of resorting to punishment. Using <u>positive reinforcement</u> will ensure comfort for both the dog and owner in this situation.</p>
<h3>Frustration and Social Aggression</h3>
<p>Dogs will often take turns in asserting dominance and making territorial claims. If two dogs assert leadership at the same time, it’s very likely to end in fighting. Also, when a dog is prevented from doing something they desire or are forced to behave differently, they will become frustrated and direct aggression toward the nearest living thing.</p>
<h3>Genetic Predisposition to Aggression</h3>
<p>Some dogs are naturally predisposed to behave aggressively; this will become more apparent as the animal ages. In this case, quality <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/general-information/">canine training courses</a> will assist you in stifling this behaviour and making long-term corrections.</p>
<h3>Territorial and Predatory Aggression</h3>
<p>In an attempt to guard or defend their space, dogs show territorial aggression such as barking and lunging at fences, windows or new people. In a similar vein, chasing smaller dogs, cats or young children shows predatory aggression driven by the animal’s instinctive desire to hunt.</p>
<h2>Overcoming Aggressive Behavioural Changes in Dogs</h2>
<h3>Reinforce Calm Behaviour</h3>
<p>If your dog begins barking or lunging when approaching other animals, turn around and force them to walk away with you. If they will not calm down, take them home. Remember that a dog will repeat allowed behaviour and this can undo a lot of basic training. Consistently introducing adolescent puppies to well-behaved adult dogs will reinforce positive, learned behaviour.</p>
<h3>Improper Correction</h3>
<p>Many owners attempt to correct their dog’s behaviour by forcing them to sit or lie down in the path of other dogs. This only teaches your animal that other dogs and people cause negative and dangerous situations that they must submit to. You must distract your dog with positive stimuli. Allowing them to play with a favourite toy in these circumstances will make your dog associate others with enjoyable feelings.</p>
<h3>Seek Professional Assistance</h3>
<p>Initiating <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/choosing-an-ndtf-trainer/">professional training</a> early will ensure you do not witness aggressive behavioural changes in your dog. You can also undertake <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/general-information/">a dog obedience course</a> so you’re fully equipped to prevent negative behaviours within your home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For dogs that are over-stimulated, prone to aggression or highly reactive, incorporating play with training can lead to amazing results. In this article, we’ll delve into the surprising perks of having fun with your dog.</p>
<p><span id="more-118"></span></p>
<h2>Defining and Understanding Playful Dog Behaviour</h2>
<p>Owners often wrongly perceive appropriate play as dangerous behaviour while others are unaware of the risks they are taking when they allow their dogs to engage in inappropriate play behaviour.</p>
<p>Play is spontaneous, voluntary, rewarding and done entirely for its own sake – you can tell the difference compared to aggressive behaviour because play is incomplete, exaggerated or awkward. Play will only be initiated when the animal is fed, healthy and stress-free as it requires a certain level of relaxation.</p>
<p>There are a few differences between play fighting and actual displays of aggression. When playing, dogs will inhibit their force and occasionally perform a self-handicap by rolling on their backs or allowing themselves to be caught during a chase. These actions would never occur during a real fight. Partaking in a certified <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/general-information/">dog obedience course</a> will equip you with the knowledge to differentiate between these behaviours.</p>
<h2>Redirecting a Hyperactive Dog’s Energy</h2>
<p>Play is an underrated tool when working with dogs that are over-stimulated, frustrated or lack impulse control because it incorporates positive reinforcement with energy-burning activities. Instead of relying on treats, you can introduce your dog to real-life rewards by moulding their favourite games into training techniques and being a part of the <u>reward experience.</u></p>
<p>The best <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/learning-to-understand-obedience-training-for-dogs/">obedience training</a> occurs when the activity you’ve chosen feels like a game to your dog, rather than a lesson. Following games teach your dog to heel, tugging games practice “take it” and “drop it” manoeuvres, and chase games teach recall behaviour.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Right Games for Your Dog</h2>
<p>Each puppy has their own set of likes and dislikes. Some dogs are naturally interested in retrieving, making fetch their favourite game. Other dogs enjoy chasing or being chased while some overly energetic dogs enjoy horseplay and roughhousing. Pay attention to your dog whenever they are introduced to other dogs to determine what games they are naturally inclined to.</p>
<p>Ensure your initial play training sessions are short, fun and at an appropriate level. When playing tug with your dog, if their teeth touch your hand or they shake the toy too violently for you to maintain grip, merely drop the toy and walk away. Keep the game at a level where your <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/top-10-tips-for-professional-dog-trainers/">rate of reinforcement</a> is high. If you’re playing fetch and your dog has to run a long distance to retrieve the ball, they will lose interest in the game because it requires too much effort. If your dog is engaged, <a href="http://www.ndtf.net.au/choosing-an-ndtf-trainer/">training</a> will be a much simpler endeavour.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dog trainers often differ in their views on pet training techniques. The truth is that trainers have different levels of education and their pet training experiences often differ. <span id="more-45"></span>That’s why topics pertaining to certain pet issues are highly debatable. Despite the differing views though, there are some things that remain constant. These are 5 most common myths that are universally considered to be wrong.</p>
<h2>Myth No. 1: My Dog is too Stubborn to be Trained</h2>
<p>If you think your dog is too stubborn, aggressive or silly to be trained, think again. The reason why your pet’s behaviour doesn’t change is probably because they don’t understand what you’re trying to communicate with them. In other instances, they might have not yet associated ‘the reward’ with the ‘correct behaviour’. Another thing you ought to remember is that your pet is not going to concentrate on behaviour modification if they’re being distracted by external sources in the environment. Lastly, pets may not change their behaviour patterns if the training doesn’t continue at home. If you forget to reward your pet as soon as they exhibits the right behaviour, the training might not be very successful or it could take longer than usual.</p>
<h2>Myth No. 2: My Dog’s Behaviour will Improve in Time</h2>
<p>If you constantly ignore unacceptable behaviour patterns, these habits will soon get ingrained in him and they will only become stronger with the passage of time. Plenty of dogs end up in animal shelters because of serious behavioural issues. Avoid the stress of having to give your dog away and get him trained instead.</p>
<h2>Myth No. 3: You Can Housetrain Your Pet by Rubbing his Nose in his Own Mess</h2>
<p>The key to proper training is communication. By rubbing your dog’s nose in his poo, you’re not communicating the right message. Look for ways to reward him for doing his job outdoors instead. Focus on positive reinforcement instead of punishment. By rubbing his nose in his accidents you might want to make him feel guilty. The truth is that researchers are not sure whether animals feel guilty the same way we humans do. So skip the nose rubbing and use tried and tested methods of housebreaking instead.</p>
<h2>Myth No. 4: My Dog Urinates on My Bed to Show Me His Anger</h2>
<p>Dogs don’t think the way we humans do. The cause of the urination incident is most likely related to a housebreaking issue. It might also stem from a urinary tract infection. Before you think your pet is trying to get back at you, make sure you eliminate these causes and have your pet checked by a vet to be doubly sure.</p>
<h2>Myth No. 5: Pet Training Should Begin at 6 Months of Age</h2>
<p>This one couldn’t be farther away from the truth. Pets should ideally start obedience training when they’re around 7 weeks old. Even though they’re still small puppies at this stage, they observe other pets and learn to socialise with them. It’s important to get them to meet new people and pets while they’re young so that they can grow into confident adult dogs.</p>
<p>If you can’t handle the training process on your own, it’s a good idea to book obedience training sessions with a dog training professional. The National Dog Trainers Federation employs trained and highly educated dog trainers in Australia. We have to meet strict standards laid down by the NDTF and we’re capable of dealing with any kind of canine behavioural issue.</p>
<p>Our trainers are aware of the problems exhibited by different breeds and they follow scientifically proven methodologies of pet training. We also offer professional dog trainer courses that can be completed online or onsite in Melbourne. So if you want to hone your pet training skills, this course may be right for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dogs are a different species that communicate with us differently. They have specific needs and different behaviour patterns, some of which are considered socially unacceptable. <span id="more-38"></span>In order to take your pet out in public and have him obey your commands, it’s important to consider signing up for obedience training lessons.</p>
<h2>Principle of Obedience Training</h2>
<p>Training simply boils down to rewarding good behaviour or correcting bad behaviour through positive reinforcement. It doesn’t have to involve the use of electric collars, squirt bottles or prong collars. Licensed and accredited institutions like the National Dog Trainers Federation abide by a code of ethics to protect pets from inhumane behaviour. This is also reflected in the strategies they use to train pets. It’s important to sign up with accredited trainers so that your pet is surrounded by love and gets the attention he deserves during the training process.</p>
<h2>What Does Obedience Training Teach Your Pet?</h2>
<p>Obedience training is a dog-friendly training program designed to teach pets to obey commands. Once the basic training is over, your pet should be able to sit, stay, and come when you say the words. Consistent training is key to the success of the program. In short, your pet should be able to listen to your commands every time. The training helps to strengthen the relationship between the owner and the pet, it builds trust, and helps your pet react appropriately in stressful situations. Obedience training sessions can be built around the needs of each dog. Some pets may be aggressive while others may have problems with housebreaking. Professional dog trainers in Australia are experts in dog behaviour. So they’re able to train all breeds and pets of all age groups.</p>
<h2>Other Benefits of Obedience Training</h2>
<p>Pets are mentally stimulated during training sessions. They’re challenged and given an opportunity to perform new tasks. You could, for instance, get your dog trained to locate your keys. With proper reinforcement your pet will be able to sniff your keys out no matter where they’re lost. Through obedience training they learn to socialise with other pets and communicate with them effectively. Training can last several months. It depends on the age of your pet and the type of training you’ve selected.</p>
<h2>How Early Should You Start Training Your Pet?</h2>
<p>Lessons can begin as early as 9 weeks of age. You will have to make sure you stay on top of your pet’s vaccination schedule in order to prevent the transmission or contraction of pet illnesses. If you start early, you’ll be able to prevent undesirable behaviours and you will cherish your time with your well-mannered puppy.</p>
<h2>Your Responsibility as a Pet Owner</h2>
<p>If you’ve signed up for dog obedience training lessons, you’ll have to work with the instructor to modify your pet’s undesirable behaviour. If you don’t follow through, your pet will receive mixed responses and the training will take much longer. The RSPCA encourages dog obedience training in Australia. So if you’ve adopted a pet or bought a new puppy, consider signing your pet up for obedience training lessons. You’ll be a step closer to living with a well-disciplined canine friend.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walking your pet doesn’t have to be a boring chore. There are several pet friendly parks and beaches in Melbourne that make dog walking an absolute pleasure. <span id="more-34"></span>Although some parks have leashed zones, there are plenty of open spaces where pets can roam about unleashed amidst native trees and patches of green.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Fawkner Park</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This park welcomes plenty of sporting groups throughout the year. It’s an ideal retreat for those who require a quick breath of fresh air in the heart of the city. People living in high rises will enjoy the peace and serenity of Fawkner Park as they ramble through its pathways lined with majestic oaks and tall poplars. What’s more is that the park has a designated off-lead area for pets to tumble around in. It makes an ideal spot for pet playdates.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Kilda Beach</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The bayside suburb of St. Kilda is known for its vibrant café lifestyle. Hordes of people descend upon this precinct every day to hit the beach, the botanical gardens or Luna Park. West St.  Kilda beach throws its sandy shores open to beach loving dogs. The Port Phillip Council has put into place several dog friendly policies. So you can take your furry friend along for some sniffing, rough play, and soggy beachside fun.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Clayton Reserve</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the corner of Macaulay Reserve and Boundary Road is Clayton Reserve, an urban sanctuary not far from the CBD. What’s great about this park is that it’s completely fenced so your pet won’t have the opportunity to run off without your knowledge. If your pet likes to socialise, this is the perfect place to visit. You’ll also get to meet several pet friendly people at the park so next time you’re looking for a new place to walk your pet, make sure you visit Clayton reserve. The park also has benches, a water fountain, poo bags and a doggie dish.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Princes Park</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re wondering whether you should train your dog on your own or get a professional trainer to do the same, you must keep a few things in mind. <span id="more-29"></span>If you decide to train your pet on your own, you will be able to develop a wonderful relationship with the dog and you won’t have to make payments for training sessions, so it certainly has its own advantages. If you decide to use a trainer though, your pet will be trained by a professional who has the necessary knowledge and skills that are essential for dealing with canine behavioural issues. Some trainers have been working with dogs for most of their lives. They thoroughly understand why dogs behave in socially unacceptable ways and they will be able to tell you whether certain reactions are just behavioural issues or reactions caused by underlying health issues that need veterinary intervention.</p>
<h2>Types of Trainings Available</h2>
<p>From obedience training to snake avoidance training, agility training and search and rescue, the options are vast. If you only want your pet to behave appropriately at home and outdoors, obedience training might be the best choice for you. Trainers will address common canine concerns like excessive barking, chewing, jumping, and inappropriate elimination. Pets can also be taught a few tricks and they will be encouraged to lead an active and social life.</p>
<p>Agility training teaches your pet to race through agility courses with speed and accuracy. This training should be performed by trained professionals as dog’s are more likely to suffer from sports injuries when the trainings are not conducted appropriately. Once trained, the pet can participate in agility competitions held at various clubs.</p>
<p>Search and rescue training taps into the pet’s natural instincts. It teaches them to perform live person searches on different terrains. Pets are first taught to search for their owners. Depending on the level of training attained, the dog will then be able to search and rescue people/cadavers trapped in the wilderness, in urban areas, in waterbodies or in places where natural disasters have occurred.</p>
<p>Snake avoidance teaches your pet to identify and avoid snakes. It also teaches you how to treat your pet if he gets bitten by a snake.</p>
<h2>Signing Your Pet Up for Training</h2>
<p>Instead of buying special equipment to train your pet, you could simply pay for training sessions and use the skill and experience of the trainer to teach your dog valuable lessons. The National Dog Training Federation employs the best dog trainers in the nation. The trainers have to meet strict criteria laid down by the federation to be authorised to work as dog trainers. Our trainers can conduct in-home training sessions or they can do them at our modern Boarding and Training Facility. We strive for excellence through our training programs. All our instructors meet the minimum level of dog training education that’s required and they have years of practical experience. We enforce a strict Code of Ethics by which our trainers are legally bound so you can be sure your pet is in safe hands.</p>
<p>To find out more about our accredited dog trainers in Australia, visit us online or give us a call on 1300 66 44 66. We will help you choose the right trainer based on your pet’s special needs.</p>

<p>Training a pet, whether it’s a playful newly acquired puppy or a rescue dog, is very important because it sets the stage for right behavioural patterns. With the help of positive reinforcement techniques, you will be able to shape your pet’s behaviour and encourage him to behave in a socially acceptable manner.<span id="more-23"></span></p>
<p><strong>Top 10 Tips to Remember</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Dealing with Unvaccinated Pets</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to successfully complete obedience training, you must begin by verifying the puppy’s vaccination history. It’s best to not bring the puppy in contact with other dogs of the same age group until important vaccines have been administered. This will prevent other pets from acquiring diseases from the dog you’re training and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Encouraging Social Skills</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Dogs have what is known as a critical socialisation period between 3 and 17 weeks of age. During this time, it’s important to allow the puppy to come in contact with other puppies that are both healthy and friendly. This will help the puppy to build social skills, observe other pets, and relate to pets of their own age group. Arrange for puppy play dates with clients who have dogs of the same age. Also make sure they have a safe environment to freely roam about in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Learn to Tackle Some of the Most Common Behavioural Issues</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a professional dog trainer there are a few behavioural issues that are common across most dog breeds. Some of the most popular complaints you’re going to hear from clients are ‘my pet keeps jumping on me’, ‘my pet is destroying my shoes, ‘I’m finding it hard to toilet train my puppy’, ‘my dog won’t stop barking’ and ‘my dog keeps digging up the yard’.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Using Positive Reinforcement</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Puppies want to please their owners or trainers so use this to help them reach your behaviour modification goals. Learning when and how to positively reinforce is extremely important. Instead of commanding them to not exhibit a particular behaviour, you should instead tell them what to do, when to do and how to do it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Understand Dog Breeds</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all dog breeds have the same behavioural traits. Learn to distinguish the needs of each breed and find out how to tackle common canine problems for each breed.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2>Training the Pet Owner</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s very important to talk to the owner about following through with the same training techniques at home. If positive reinforcement doesn’t continue and the pet has his own way at home, the training won’t be successful. Clients will come back frustrated and ask you why the dog’s behaviour hasn’t improved. In order to modify unacceptable behaviour, it’s equally important for the pet owner to establish rules at home and offer rewards when the dog obeys those rules/commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2>Use Games to Train the Pet</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of merely taking the puppy for a walk or having a conversation to develop a relationship with the dog, use games to make the training session fun and enjoyable. Once you’ve developed a relation with the pet, it will be easier to get him to obey your commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h2>Understand the Risks That Come with Certain Pet Sports</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re offering agility training, you must be aware of the risks of injury that come along with the sport. The height of the hurdle and type of obstacle course selected should be based on the dog’s breed, weight, and age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h2>Find out the Psychology behind Pet Behaviour</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a dog trainer it’s very helpful to know why pets behave in a certain manner. Not all behaviour boils down to disobedience. Some pets react aggressively when they’re stressed, anxious or fearful. Identify the causes of stress and discuss these with the pet owner in order to help the puppy develop into a happy and healthy pet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h2>Consider Taking a Refresher Course in Dog Training</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve been working as a professional dog trainer for several years but don’t know about the latest dog training techniques available, you could benefit from a certificate course in dog training. The NDTF offers a Certificate III in Dog Behaviour and Training. You can pursue this through distance learning or part-time at their centre in Melbourne. This is the only government accredited and nationally recognised program offered in the nation. It gives you the chance to interact with some of the best dog trainers and veterinary professionals in Australia. The course covers all aspects of training and it will help you network with other dog trainers in Australia.</p>
